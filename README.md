### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder to work on the frontend.
3. Install dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the frontend server using:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
   This will start the React development server along with Tailwind CSS integration and React Router Dom for routing. You can access your frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Open another terminal and navigate to the `api` folder to work on the backend.
6. Install backend dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
7. Start the backend server using:
    ```bash
    nodemon index.js
    ```
   This will start the Node.js server, enabling API endpoints for authentication, profile management, and CRUD operations. Your backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

8. Customize and extend the frontend and backend functionalities to suit your project requirements.

9. Deploy your application using Render or any other hosting service of your choice.
